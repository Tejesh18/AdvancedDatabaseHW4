## **Introduction**
This assignment focuses on the concept of **Database Normalization**, which is a systematic approach to organizing data in relational databases. The primary goal is to reduce redundancy and ensure the integrity of data. We explore multiple normal forms, including **3NF**, **BCNF**, and **4NF**, along with the concepts of **functional dependencies**, **multi-valued dependencies**, and **decomposition**.

The key concepts covered in this assignment will help in designing normalized and efficient database schemas, ensuring minimal data redundancy and the prevention of various anomalies that may arise in poorly designed databases.

Through a series of questions and practical examples, we will demonstrate how to apply normalization principles to real-world database scenarios.
